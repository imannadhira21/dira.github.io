</p>

<p>The Istana Raja Billah may not actually be a palace, despite its name strongly implying otherwise. For the residents of the region during that period, possessing that designation was very extraordinary. The elaborate carvings adorning the roof, windows, and doors of the mansion provide an appearance of grandeur. The mentioned building is inaccessible to both guests and tourists. There are individuals who assert that it is haunted.</p>

<h4>CHAT WITH THE LOCALS</h4>
<p>
